 project Name :- Amrutam Pharmaceuticals Assignment

Here's a simplified procedure for the Amrutam Pharmaceuticals Assignment React-based static application, presented in points:

Clone the Repository:
Clone the project repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/naveenbhuvi123/amrutham-my-app.git.
Install Dependencies:
Navigate into the project directory (cd amrutham-my-app) and install the dependencies using npm install.
Start the Development Server:
Run npm start to start the development server. The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
Explore the Project Structure:
Familiarize yourself with the project structure, including the public, src, and possibly other folders.
Understand the Main Components:
Look for the main components in the src/components folder, which are likely to include the header, footer, and other reusable components.
Review the Pages:
Check the src/pages folder for components specific to different pages of the application.
Check Routing Configuration:
If the application uses React Router, review the routing configuration in the src/App.js file or a separate routing file.
Inspect State Management (if applicable):
If the application uses state management (e.g., Redux), review the setup and usage of the state management library.
Explore Styling Approach:
Look for how styles are applied, whether using CSS, CSS modules, or a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components.
Test the Application (optional):
If tests are included, run them using the appropriate command (e.g., npm test) to ensure the application behaves as expected.
Make Changes (if needed):
If you need to make changes to the application, do so in the appropriate files (e.g., components, pages) based on your requirements.
Commit Changes:
Once you've made your changes, commit them to your fork of the repository using git commit -am 'Your commit message'.
Push Changes:
Push your changes to your fork on GitHub using git push origin master (or the name of your branch).
Create a Pull Request (PR):
If you want to contribute your changes back to the original repository, create a pull request from your fork on GitHub.
Review and Merge (by project maintainers):
The project maintainers will review your pull request and merge it into the main branch if it meets the project's guidelines.
Stay Updated:
Keep your local repository updated with the latest changes from the main repository by pulling changes (git pull origin master).
This procedure provides a basic overview of how to work with the Amrutam Pharmaceuticals Assignment React-based static application. Specific details and steps may vary based on the project's actual structure and requirements.
